        <p>As you continue through the kitchen you see a door. You open the door and take a look outside. It seems to be a backyard. You decide you've had enough with this haunted house. You never should've come. You jog outside before hearing a howl behind you. You take a glance back, seeing a giant werewolf behind you. You run as fast as you can until you stumble into a fence. Realizing you are cornered you look around for weapons. You see a shard fo glass and stabbed the werewolf. The werewolf laughs as he clutches your head. He squeezes it and everything goes black.</p>
