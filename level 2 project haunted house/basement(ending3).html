        <p>As you go deeper in the basement you see white sheets covering everything. You pull on one of the white sheets to lift it over the object. Then you realize your hand is stuck to the white sheet. It seems to be some spider web. As you rip it apart hundreds if not thousands of spiders crawl out of every crook and cranny. They crawl all over you and bite you and as you try running out of the basement you start feeling dizzy and trip. You feel yourself suffocating and the swarm of spiders haul you back downstairs to their web for your demise.</p>
